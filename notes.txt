Talk notes:

  Things clojure does better:
    * macros / homoiconicity
      * metaprogramming is easier - give macro example that you can't do in ruby
    * functions in a lisp~1
    * namespaces
    * anaphora
    * destructuring
      * proposal to add in JS: http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=proposals:destructuring_assignment
    * stupid stuff
      * commas as whitespace
      * dashes instead of underscores
      * syntax sugar as described here: http://briancarper.net/blog/536/
  Things coffescript does better:
    * list comprehensions
    * whitespace sensitivity
      * show ruby without ends
    * is/isn't/in
    * ?. for soaking up nulls
      * like #try, maybe bad?
    * chained comparisons healthy = 200 > cholesterol > 60

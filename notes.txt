Talk notes:
  * Things clojure does better:
    * syntax 
      * unlimited arguments and no precedence
    * anaphora
    * functions in a lisp~1
    * macros / homoiconicity
      * metaprogramming is easier - give macro example that you can't do in ruby
    * namespaces
    * destructuring
      * proposal to add in JS: http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=proposals:destructuring_assignment
    * immutability
      * no defensive copying (no more dup!)
    * stupid stuff
      * commas as whitespace
      * dashes instead of underscores
      * syntax sugar as described here: http://briancarper.net/blog/536/
    * quote "remember: think globally, but act only through the unified update model."

    
  * MagicFS
    * At first I couldn't see ruby's flaws
      * designed in early 90s for HP handhelds
      * 26 variables a-z
      * method names are NUMBERS
      * all system functions are two-letters, case-sensitive
      * we wrote HOSPITAL SOFTARE in this stuff



=======================

Prep:
  * usual 
  * disable notes
  * get mindblown gif in right spot


Maybe:
  Coffeescript:
    * ?. for soaking up nulls
      * like #try, maybe bad?
    * chained comparisons healthy = 200 > cholesterol > 60
